   - Summarized categorical variables

3. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Analyzed sales trends over time
   - Identified peak sales months and seasonal patterns

4. **Customer and Product Analysis**
   - Examined customer purchasing behavior
   - Analyzed top-selling products and most valuable customers

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Used bar plots, line plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent insights
   - Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn

6. **Recommendations**
   - Identified actionable business strategies based on data insights
   - Suggested improvements for marketing, inventory, and customer segmentation
